Finding Patterns and Exploratory Data Analysis on Car Sales Dataset

Data mining is the process of finding patterns in the large data sets. It is the process of predicting the outcomes on the basis of discovered patterns and the correlations between various factors or variables. It can be performed through various techniques such as regression, clustering, principal component analysis, etc. In the present assignment we have performed data mining through regression and have also done the exploratory data analysis to understand and analyze the dataset. In the present assignment, we have used Car Sales dataset which contains 157 entries along with 15 column variables. The dataset contains the information about different car models manufactured by different car companies and includes variables such as pricing, sales, resale value, vehicle launch date and other car specifications. The dataset has been taken from Kaggle and can be downloaded from this link https://www.kaggle.com/hsinha53/car-sales/version/1#Car_sales.csv%20(https://www.kaggle.com/hsinha53/car-sales/version/1
